In future we might make this programable, through swtich console serial port we can automatically execute:

show mac address-table address f4:ce:46:32:75:53 

Whereby f4:ce:46:32:75:53 is the MAC address of NIC2 on the Rack Manager.  Identify the port the rack manager is connected, and update it to VLAN1

Rack Manager IP Address:

	172.17.0.202
	255.255.255.252
	
vi /etc/network/interfaces

up route add -net 172.17.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 172.17.0.201
